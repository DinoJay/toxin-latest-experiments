SCCS comment. the information provided on stability of A166 is not convincing. the use of ascorbic acid and argon for the shaking flask method, and the storage conditions (4 ± 4 °C, in the dark under argon), indicates that the test substance is easily oxidised. the applicant has provided further information on the stability studies performed for the dose formulation used for toxicity studies, where the dissolution media is distilled water. however, details on the solvent media and the procedure used for preparation of solutions are not fully described in the report. it is necessary to provide data on the stability of A166 under conditions of use with a selective analytical method. liquid scintillation counting is not a selective method for this purpose. the stability study was performed before mixing the test substance with the developer, whereas it should be performed after the mixing with the developer. any degradation products should also be chemically characterised. any degradation products should be chemically characterised.

        ont:additional_info            "DHA is a self-tanning agent. More specifically, the application of a DHA-containing selftanning formulation to the skin produces a reaction between DHA and skin contents. DHA reacts with the amino acids and amino groups of proteins present in sweat, keratin and skin, eventually leading to the production of coloured melanoidins. The applicant explains that there is much evidence to suggest that the process is similar to the \"maillard reaction\", also known as non-enzymatic browning. 2 - 6 hours after application, a brown coloration appears that has a similar hue to that of natural sun tan. as the DHA molecules are bound to free amino acids and proteins of the skin, the colour obtained is substantive and cannot easily be washed off. It only fades in the course of mechanical abrasion or natural exfoliation of the skin. DHA has been used worldwide in cosmetic products, i.e. skin care products for face and body, instant tan formulations and 'flash bronzers' in combination with colorants. The applicant (Colipa, representing 8 cosmetic companies) wishes to support the use of DHA in face creams and body lotions at a concentration of up to 10%. The recommended use levels depend on the skin type and tanning status of the user: Ca. 3 - 5 % in formulations for persons with light skin (skin type I - II), Ca. 5 - 10 % in formulations for persons with dark skin (skin type III - IV / V), Ca. 1 - 2 % in formulations for skin care products (creams and lotions). the use of DHA solutions in spray cabins, however, is not supported by Colipa, as none of its member companies manufacture products used in spray cabins. ref.: 1. a report of the danish toxicology centre (DTC) summarizes the major spraying systems used to treat customers with DHA self-tanning creams (containing 8-14% of dha): 1) the manual turbine spray or spraying ‘pistol’, spraying a high air volume under low pressure onto the skin. The formulation is sprayed from about 15 cm distance from the customer’s body. 2) the third-generation spray booth, consisting of a closed compartment in which, after a short countdown, 3 rows of nozzles spray lotion on the entire body. turning around is not necessary, as the whole body is treated in one spray action. once the spraying stops, the customer immediately leaves the spraying compartment, in which a thick aerosol mist has meanwhile been formed. 3) the fourth-generation spray booth, i.e. an open booth, in which the formulation is charged to 40,000 V and sprayed through 2 vertical rows of nozzles. the customer stands on two earthed metal plates so that the lotion hits her/his body very accurately through electrostatic energy. after 2-3 seconds, the customer turns around and the other side of the body is treated. in addition, the DTC document reports on some important exposure parameters related to each of the spraying systems, and on the DHA levels measured in the air around the mouth/nose during treatment in a number of operational booths. parameter: amount of formulation used, manual turbine spray: ± 25 ml, third-generation (closed) spray booth: ± 60 ml, fourth-generation (open) spray booth: ± 15 ml; parameter: application time, manual turbine spray: 2-3 minutes, third-generation (closed) spray booth: 6 seconds, fourth-generation (open) spray booth: 4-6 seconds; parameter: estimated inhalation exposure, manual turbine spray: aerosol cloud is minimal, thus minimal inhalation exposure, third-generation (closed) spray booth: a thick aerosol mist is present in the spraying compartment, thus inhalation is likely. fourth-generation (open) spray booth: aerosol drops are 10 x smaller than in third generation booths; nevertheless, inhalation is expected to be low due to ‘electrostatic precision’; parameter: protective measures to be taken, manual turbine spray: no specific measures, third-generation (closed) spray booth: customer is advised to keep eyes and mouth shut during treatment, fourth-generation (open) spray booth: customer is advised to use nose filters and eye protection; parameter: measured DHA concentration (droplets < 12µm), manual turbine spray: 0.8 mg/m³ air, third-generation (closed) spray booth: up to 238 mg/m³ air, fourth-generation (open) spray booth: up to 17 mg/m³ air; parameter: calculated exposure level per treatment (general inhalation rate of 1.5 m³/hour is assumed for adult man (low activity) [technical guidance document on risk assessment, part I, European commission, ecb, 2003].), manual turbine spray: (0.05h x 1.5m³/hour x 0.8 mg/m³) = 0.06 mg dha, third-generation (closed) spray booth: (0.0017h x 1.5m³/hour x 238 mg/m³) = 0.61 mg dha, fourth-generation (open) spray booth: (0.0017h x 1.5m³/hour x 17 mg/m³) = 0.04 mg dha. ref.: 12." ;

The achieved level of the active component (i.e. the silver ion) in EcoG+ packaging is 420-600 ppm. During the proposed use of the composite material as cosmetic product packaging, small amounts of silver ions are released into the cosmetic product, where a preservative function is intended. EcoG+ packaging may be used with a variety of cosmetic product types. EcoG+ glass containing silver ions will be used only in the internal parts of any packaging (i.e. the parts of the packaging in direct contact with the cosmetic product) and will not be used on external parts potentially coming into contact with the hands of the consumer.

The level of silver ion achieved in the EcoG+ packaging is therefore 420-600 ppm. As described above, EcoG+ contains three components; i.e. silver-containing phosphate glass powder, glass beads and an appropriate polymer. EcoG+ therefore acts as a carrier for the active component, the silver ion, which is intended to be released in small amounts into the cosmetic product contained within the EcoG+ packaging. The species ultimately released into the cosmetic product is the silver ion; the silver released into the cosmetic product is not in the form of colloidal silver or nanosilver. Additionally, although silver nitrate is used as the source of silver, it is important to note that the silver ion is released into the cosmetic product without the nitrate counterion.

CI 45430 (Erythrosine) is listed in Annex IV of the EU Cosmetics Directive 76/768/EEC which permits its use as a colorant in cosmetic products, without a concentration limit for this use. It is, however, not permitted as a hair dye ingredient because a safety dossier supporting its use was not provided under the European Hair Dye strategy(1) and thesubstance was subsequently banned for this use2 (Annex II, entry 1337). Erythrosine is historically reported as being used in a range of cosmetic applications including toothpaste, lipstick, eye products, face decorative products, bath & shower products, hair products including sprays & conditioners, shampoos, deodorants, fragrance products, and soap (COLIPA 2006). Following calls for toxicological data on this colour, only the use of this colour in toothpaste products has been actively defended. For this reason this dossier only supports the use of erythrosine in toothpaste products up to a level of 0.0025% and does not relate to its safety in all cosmetic applications. As a food colorant, erythrosine is added to a range of products to include sweets (Turkish delight), biscuits, glace and tinned cherries and sausages. Following a review of the available scientific data, The European Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) has allocated an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0 to 0.1 mg/kg body weight (SCF, 1987). In 1990, the same ADI was assigned by the Joint WHO/FAO Expert Committee for Food Additives (JECFA, 1990), following a re-evaluation of the safety of this colorant. In the EU, Erythrosine is permitted as a colorant in foodstuff3 . It is limited for use in cocktail cherries and candied cherries up to a maximum level of 200 mg/kg and in Bigarreaux cherries in syrup and cocktails up to 150 mg/kg. Erythrosine is also approved for use in EU pharmaceutical preparations as a colorant in both solid (capsules/tablets/sugar-coated pills) and liquid (drops/syrups) pharmaceutical preparations. In 1988, The Scientific Committee on Medicinal Products and Medical Devices (SCMPMD) issued a favourable opinion on the use of erythrosine in pharmaceutical products. Erythrosine is typically present at levels of 0.0017 to 0.96 mg/capsule or tablet respectively and at levels of 0.009 to 0.8 mg/mL for oral liquid preparations. In the US, FD&C Red 3 is permanently listed for use in foods and ingested drugs. In 1990, erythrosine was de-listed by FDA for use in cosmetics and externally applied drugs, following the initial suggested findings that this colorant may induce carcinogenicity in rats. The FDA adopted the Delaney clause which restricts the use of any ingredient, regardless of the amount used, if an ingredient is shown to induce cancer in animals or humans. The FDA did not have an immediate safety concern with this colorant and identified the potential risk based on the data available as about 1 in 100, 000 over a 70 year lifetime. This colorant remains approved for use in the U.S. in foods and ingested drugs. 1: http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sectors/cosmetics/cosmetic-products/hair-dye-products/safety-strategy/index_en.htm" ;

        ont:additional_info            "the naturally occurring compound β-arbutin (4-hydroxyphenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside, hydroquinone-β-glucopyranoside, CAS 497-76-7) is a β-D-glucopyranoside derivative of hydroquinone that can be found in the leaves and bark of many plants. it has been proposed for use as a skin-lightening agent, inhibiting production of the skin pigment melanin which is formed through a series of oxidative reactions involving the amino acid tyrosine and the enzyme tyrosinase. this enzyme catalyses the hydroxylation of tyrosine to L-DOPA (dihydroxyphenylalanine) and the oxidation of DOPA to dopaquinone which is then further metabolised to melanin. β-Arbutin is thought to act by inhibition of the activity of melanosomal tyrosinase, where the inhibition may be due to structural similarities to the substrate tyrosine (Zhu and Gao, 2008). β-arbutin can be hydrolysed both in acid solution and by enzymic action to hydroquinone which also acts as a skin lightening agent, again by inhibiting tyrosinase. Extended use of ≥2% hydroquinone, topically applied, has been associated with adverse effects including exogenous ochronosis in dark-skinned people. hydroquinone, like β-arbutin, is present in many dietary components in trace amounts and is metabolised in vivo to its glucuronide and sulphate conjugates. β-arbutin is proposed to be used as a skin-lightening agent in cosmetic face creams or face lotions at concentrations up to 7%." ;

        ont:homogeneity_and_stability  "the stability of β-arbutin was evaluated as a raw material as well as in a cosmetic formulation. as a raw material : photostability test in aqueous solution (test of 2006) sample preparation: concentration of β-Arbutin (Lot TQI-771, TQI-772, TQI-773) were 3% and 6.3%; dissolved in 10% ethanol and water. light Source - a white fluorescent lamp and near ultraviolet lamp. procedure - Samples were kept in transparent glass bottle of 50mL. protected samples wrapped in aluminium foil were used as controls. samples were exposed to light providing an overall illumination of no less than 1.2 million lux hours and an integrated near ultraviolet energy of no less than 200 w·h/m2 at 25°C then measured instantly in compliance with ICH guidelines, the analysis being repeated 3 times for each lot of product, using an HPLC assay with detection at 280 nm. the quantitation limit of HQ in the samples was 1 ppm. conclusion:no apparent change in the amount of β-arbutin was observed between light-exposed and control samples. a slight increase of hydroquinone, on the other hand, was observed in lightexposed 6.3% solutions although those levels were always below 2.5 ppm after light exposure. photostability at different pH values and temperatures (Test date 2008-9) sample type: 7% β-arbutin in phosphate buffers ranging from pH 2.0-11.0, samples prepared from Lot TTG-305 were subdivided and kept in transparent glass bottles (30ml). protected samples wrapped in aluminium foil were used as dark controls. samples were exposed to light (white fluorescent lamp) providing an overall illumination of no less than 1.2 million lux hours and an integrated near ultraviolet energy of no less than 200 w･h/m2 at 25ο (ICH guidelines). the effects of temperature were studied at 50°C for 1 month and 40°C for 3 months. the analyses were repeated 3 times for each lot of product. the authors concluded that for both the heat and light conditions, no apparent change on the amount of β-arbutin was observed at pH 4-11. β-arbutin levels were slightly decreased at pH ≤3 accompanied by a rapid increase of hydroquinone. the degree of hydroquinone generation was higher at low pH (~4,300ppm at 50°C 1 month and 3,700ppm at 40°C 3 months at pH 2); however only trace levels of hydroquinone were detected in neutral to basic solutions (pH 6-11). in a cosmetic formulation: accelerated test conditions for 6 months/ date of study: 2008-2009/method: Internal protocol Shiseido Co, Japan/test substance: Shiseido product C (Lot 0804A, B, C) containing 5.67-6.93% β-arbutin at pH 5.0-7.0/temperature: 40°C/relative humidity 75%/analytical method: HPLC/ samples were kept in a transparent glass bottle at 40°C and 75% relative humidity for 6 months. β-arbutin and hydroquinone concentrations were measured in threefold by HPLC for each batch at the start of the study, after 3 months and after 6 months. conclusions:  since the concentrations of β-arbutin were stable and those of hydroquinone remained below 1 ppm (detection limit), the study authors conclude that β-arbutin is stable in final cosmetic formulations and that no hydroquinone is released under accelerated ageing conditions for 6 months. ambient test conditions for 36 months, i.e.,long-term testing/date of study: 2003-6/method: internal protocol Shiseido Co, Japan/test substance: Shiseido product C (lot A, B, C) containing 5.67-6.93% β-arbutin (pH5.0-7.0)/temperature: 25°C/relative humidity: 60%/analytical method: HPLC/ samples of Shiseido product C were kept in a transparent glass bottle at ambient conditions for 3 years. β-arbutin and hydroquinone concentrations were measured in threefold by HPLC at the start and at the end of the study. since the concentrations of β-arbutin were stable and those of hydroquinone remained below 1 ppm (detection limit), the study authors conclude that β-arbutin is stable in the usual cosmetic formulation and that no hydroquinone is released under normal storage conditions for 3 years. overall conclusion:  β-arbutin is stable in final cosmetic formulations, hydroquinone content in the finished product was no more than 1 ppm (LLOQ) throughout the accelerated and longterm storage conditions (40°C, 75% relative humidity for 6 months and (25°C, 60% relative humidity for 36 months). β-arbutin was relatively stable to light when dissolved in a 10% ethanol aqueous solution. no significant change in the amount of β-arbutin was detected and only trace levels of hydroquinone (<0.25 ppm) were detected under the conditions of the ICH photostability test. β-arbutin was found to be unstable in low pH solutions, decrease of β-arbutin and significant increase of hydroquinone was observed, especially at pH 2. a recently published study(Yang CH et al. 2013) tested ß-arbutin (and deoxy-arbutin) at 10^-4 M (<0.003 % w/v) in aqueous solution with 10% propylene glycol and UV irradiation (narrow band UVB lightunit at 312 nm) at 2.65 mW/cm2: under these conditions (pH not given), ß-arbutin wasreduced to 43.5% of the initial level after 2 h of irradiation, and hydroquinone was detectedat significant levels (up to 20%) over the test period (up to 12 h). SCCS comment: as the test concentration is far below that used in cosmetic products, this study, Yang CH et al. is considered to be of limited relevance. the results presented in the respective studies regarding photostability testing (according to ICH guideline) and pH- or temperature-dependent stabilities of β-arbutin sound conclusive and reliable. In cosmetic formulations hydroquinone as impurity remained below 1 ppm (detection limit). yet, aside from reduced photostability under certain UV irradiation conditions (Yang et al. 2013), it is to be considered that β-arbutin may also undergo cutaneous hydrolysis into hydroquinone due to enzymatic activity through β-glucosidases in skin (Mier & van den Hurk 1976; Redoules et al. 2005) or via the activity of microbes residing on the surface of the skin (Bang et al. 2008).

Chemical characterisation was performed by UV, FTIR and 1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopy on the batches 1442/3+4 and C-1701/8. The 13C-spectra showed the expected signals for the given structure. The 1H-NMR results, however, showed the presence of an isomeric mixture. The non-GLP results obtained from different NMR experiments revealed a time- dependent isomerisation of the test item (Z-isomer) to the corresponding E-isomer upon dissolution. The time-dependent investigation yielded equilibrium after ca. 5 hours of an isomeric mixture with a ratio of 1.98: 1.00 for Z-isomer to E-isomer. The UV filter C-1701 B_C_3 is synthesised as Z-isomer and upon dissolution it isomerises within 5 hours to approximately 60% Z-isomer and ca. 40% E-isomer. Purity of UV filter C-1701 B_C_3 was determined by quantitative 1H-NMR spectroscopy with internal standard on the batches 1442/3+4 and C-1701/8.

One-generation reproduction toxicity: stability, homogeneity and content of the solutions of hc red n° 13 in the vehicle were analytically confirmed. dosing solutions were prepared once per week as stability in the vehicle for up to 7 days could be demonstrated. the mean concentrations of the test samples were 98 and 103%, 99.9 and 101.6% as well as 100.4 and 99.2% of the nominal values for the three dose groups analysed twice at the beginning and at the end of the administration period. these values confirmed proper dosing for the entire study period. the slight variation (-2 to 1%) noted for the three samples taken from each dosing solution demonstrates the homogeneity of the test solutions used. Teratogenicity study: stability, homogeneity and content of the solutions of hc red n° 13 were analytically confirmed. dosing solutions were prepared once per week as stability in the vehicle for up to 7 days could be demonstrated. the mean recovery rates of the test samples were 95.4 and 98.4%, 98.6 and 97.6% as well as 98.7 and 96.7% of the nominal values for the low, mid and high dose groups, respectively, analysed twice at the beginning and at the end of the administration period. these values confirmed proper dosing for the entire study period. stability under oxidative conditions: the stability of the dyestuff kardinalrot in a 1:1 mixture of a crème formulation (formula no. 81207116) and hydrogen peroxide 6% (welloxon 6%) was examined by means of hplc. the recoveries of the dyestuff determined after 15 min, 30 min and 45 min were 93.8%, 93.3% and 90.8% respectively. the sccs considers a decrease below 10% as not significant due to uncertainties connected with the analytical measurements.

Lysmeral®extra is prevented from auto-oxidating to the corresponding acid by alpha- tocopherol, which is present in the final product at 200 ppm (references: BASF 2016, 2017 SMII: 5, 6, 35). the shelf life of Lysmeral®extra is 730 days at 25°C (references: BASF 1998 SMII: 34).
